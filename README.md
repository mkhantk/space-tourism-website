## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux with Redux toolkit
- React Router

### What I learned

Well, I've learned a lot, I planned to use redux here because, I was learning the usage of redux in a practical way. I find it easy coming from the useContext/useReducer combo although there is only a little of state management in this project. Anyway, I think this is the best way to level up your skills, by doing projects. Well, I got to read a lot of doc but in the end, it work out well. I do appreciate the figma files provided for the design.
